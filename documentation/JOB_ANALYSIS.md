# Ultrasound AI - Job Analysis

## Company Overview
- **Mission:** Health-tech advancing women's health with AI
- **Team:** Small, fast-moving, mission-driven
- **Focus:** Accessible, accurate, patient-centered care

## Role: "Vibe Coding" Engineer

### Core Philosophy
1. **Readable code** - Small modules, clear names
2. **Tests first** - Fast unit tests that document behavior
3. **Tasteful abstractions** - No overengineering
4. **Infer edge cases** - Handle what's not spelled out
5. **AI-assisted** - Use tools but maintain judgment

### Day-to-Day Work
- Design backend services, data/ML pipelines
- Write production-quality tests and resilient code
- Turn ambiguous requirements into testable APIs
- Maintain healthy codebases (refactor, document)
- Collaborate with product/clinical experts

## Interview Deep Dive

### Format Confirmation
**Matches your prep email exactly:**
- ✅ 2-hour onsite coding exercise
- ✅ Your laptop + IDE
- ✅ AI tools explicitly allowed (Copilot, ChatGPT)
- ✅ Backend/data/ML focus (no UI)
- ✅ Automated script to test solution

### What They Grade
1. **Correctness** - Does it work?
2. **Edge cases** - Did you infer unstated requirements?
3. **Maintainability** - Clean, readable code
4. **Tests** - Unit tests that pin behavior

### Deliverables
- Working code
- Unit tests
- Short README (assumptions/tradeoffs)

### Possible Challenge Domains
- Event dedupe & compaction (streams, idempotency)
- Rules/feature-flag engine (DSL, precedence)
- Token-bucket rate limiter (boundary behavior)
- Cron calculator (DST/timezone edge cases)
- Double-entry ledger (invariants, decimals)
- GPU-aware PyTorch batch scorer (device selection)

## Key Requirements

### Must Have
- 3+ years professional experience
- **Python** (or C++, TypeScript, Rust, Java)
- **Unit testing discipline**
- Data structures, concurrency, system boundaries

### Nice to Have
- PyTorch experience
- Cloud patterns (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Healthcare/HIPAA awareness

## Compensation
- **Base:** $100K-$400K (DOE, multiple levels)
- **Type:** 90-day contract-to-hire → full-time
- **Benefits:** Health, Dental, Vision, 401(k), PTO

## Strategic Insights

### What Makes You Stand Out
1. **AI tool proficiency** - They explicitly want engineers who use AI effectively
2. **Test-driven mindset** - Tests first is their philosophy
3. **Edge case thinking** - Infer unstated requirements
4. **Clean code** - Maintainability over cleverness
5. **Healthcare context** - Women's health mission alignment

### Interview Strategy
1. **Start with tests** - Write test cases to clarify requirements
2. **Think edge cases** - DST, timezones, malformed data, boundaries
3. **Use AI confidently** - They want to see effective AI usage
4. **Keep it simple** - Readable > clever
5. **Document assumptions** - README with tradeoffs

### Red Flags to Avoid
- ❌ Overengineering / premature optimization
- ❌ Throwaway hacks / brittle code
- ❌ Missing edge cases
- ❌ No tests or poor test coverage
- ❌ Unclear naming / poor documentation

## Preparation Checklist

### Technical
- [ ] Python environment tested and ready
- [ ] Unit testing framework (pytest) configured
- [ ] AI tools (ChatGPT/Copilot) accessible
- [ ] Practice writing READMEs with assumptions
- [ ] Review edge case patterns (DST, boundaries, idempotency)

### Mindset
- [ ] Test-first approach
- [ ] Think aloud about edge cases
- [ ] Balance speed with maintainability
- [ ] Use AI as accelerator, not crutch
- [ ] Prepare mission alignment talking points

### Logistics
- [ ] Confirm availability with Leah
- [ ] Test Python + IDE on laptop
- [ ] Bring charger
- [ ] Plan route to Centennial, CO office
- [ ] Prepare code samples/repos (optional)

## Mission Alignment Points
- Women's health accessibility and accuracy
- AI for practical healthcare impact
- Patient-centered care
- Small team, direct clinical impact
